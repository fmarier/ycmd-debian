Description: code-completion & comprehension server
 ycmd is a server that provides APIs for code-completion and other
 code-comprehension use-cases like semantic GoTo commands (and others). For
 certain filetypes, ycmd can also provide diagnostic errors and warnings.
 .
 ycmd was originally part of YouCompleteMe's codebase, but has been split out
 into a separate project so that it can be used in editors other than Vim.
