ycmd (0+20150327+git03d18ea-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO:
  - Fill a ITP bug.
  - Fix rpath issue:
    E: ycmd: binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath usr/lib/ycmd/ycm_core.so /usr/lib/llvm-3.5/lib
  - Find correct Section.
  - ycm_core.so is linking librt and libboost-thread but it doesn't use any
    of this libraries. libboost-thread only used for tests and that's why it
    should stay in Build-Depends.

  * Initial release. (Closes: #0)
